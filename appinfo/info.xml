# Memories

Memories is a photo management app for Nextcloud with advanced features including:

* **📸 Timeline**: Sort photos and videos by date taken, parsed from Exif data.
* **⏪ Rewind**: Jump to any time in the past instantly and relive your memories.
* **🤖 AI Tagging**: Group photos by people and objects using AI, powered by the [recognize](https://github.com/nextcloud/recognize) app.
* **🖼️ Folders**: Browse your own and shared folders with a similar, efficient timeline.
* **🎦 Slideshow**: View photos from your timeline and folders easily.
* **📱 Mobile Support**: Works on devices of any shape and size through the web app.
* **✏️ Edit Metadata**: Edit Exif dates on photos quickly and easily.
* **📦 Archive**: Store photos you don't want to see in your timeline in a separate folder.
* **⚡️ Fast**: Memories is extremely fast. Period.

To get an idea of what memories looks and feels like, check out the [public demo](https://memories-demo.radialapps.com/apps/memories/). Note that the demo is read-only and may be slow since it runs in a low-end free tier VM provided by [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). Photo credits go to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (for individual credits, refer to each folder).

## 🚀 Installation

1. Install the app from the Nextcloud app store
1. Run `php ./occ memories:index` to generate metadata indices for existing photos.
1. Open the 📷 Memories app in Nextcloud and set the directory containing your photos. Photos from this directory will be displayed in the timeline, including any photos in nested subdirectories.
1. Installing the [preview generator](https://github.com/rullzer/previewgenerator) for pre-generating thumbnails is strongly recommended.
